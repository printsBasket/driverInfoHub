              <h2>What the USB Stack Does</h2>
              <p>When you connect a device, a chain of drivers springs into action: a host-controller driver manages the physical port, a hub driver tracks what's attached, and a class or device driver knows how to speak to that specific kind of hardware — a keyboard, a drive, a camera.</p>
              <p>Together they enumerate the device, assign it resources, and load the right software so it simply works, often with no action from you at all.</p>
              <ul className="ticks">
                <li>Detects and enumerates newly connected devices</li>
                <li>Loads the correct class or device-specific driver</li>
                <li>Manages power delivery and port resources</li>
                <li>Supports hubs, daisy-chaining, and hot-plugging</li>

              <h2>When a Device Isn't Recognised</h2>
              <p>An unknown-device error, a drive that mounts then vanishes, or a port that charges but won't transfer data — these point to the USB stack rather than the gadget itself.</p>
              <p>Trying another port, reseating the cable, and reinstalling the device-specific driver from its maker clears up most cases. A surprising number are simply a tired cable or a port stuck in a low-power state after sleep.</p>

            <ol className="fixsteps">
              <li><strong>Swap the cable</strong> — Cables fail far more often than ports or drivers do — always try a known-good cable first.</li>
              <li><strong>Try a different port</strong> — Move from a hub or front‑panel port to one directly on the machine itself.</li>
              <li><strong>Reinstall the device driver</strong> — Uninstall it in Device Manager, unplug, restart, then reconnect.</li>
              <li><strong>Update the controller driver</strong> — Install the chipset / USB controller package from your machine's maker — it underpins every port.</li>
              <li><strong>Disable selective suspend</strong> — If a device drops out after idle periods, turn off USB selective suspend in your power options.</li>

              <div className="faq-body">
                <p>Usually USB power management putting the port to sleep, or a marginal cable. A current driver plus disabling 'USB selective suspend' for that controller resolves most repeat disconnects.</p>
