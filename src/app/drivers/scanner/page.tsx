              <h2>What a Scanner Driver Does</h2>
              <p>A scanner driver implements the standard scanning interfaces that imaging applications rely on. When any app asks for “a 300 dpi colour scan of this area,” the driver translates that request into hardware commands, runs the sensor across the page, and streams the image data back to whichever program asked.</p>
              <p>On multifunction printer-scanner devices there's an important wrinkle: the scanning driver is a separate piece of software from the printing driver. They ship together in the maker's full package — but a print-only installation quietly leaves scanning out, which explains one of the most common support mysteries below.</p>
              <ul className="ticks">
                <li>Implements the standard interfaces scanning apps rely on</li>
                <li>Carries resolution, colour, and area settings to the hardware</li>
                <li>Streams the scanned image back to your software</li>
                <li>Installs separately from printing on multifunction devices</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>When the Printer Works but the Scanner Doesn't</h2>
              <p>It's the classic multifunction complaint: printing is flawless, yet every scanning app insists no scanner exists. Nine times out of ten, the machine was set up with a basic or print-only driver, and the scanning half of the software simply was never installed.</p>
              <p>The second classic is network scanning: printing travels one way, but scans travel back from the device to your computer — and a firewall can silently block that return path. Installing the maker's full package and allowing its scan utility through the firewall resolves the overwhelming majority of cases.</p>

            <ol className="fixsteps">
              <li><strong>Test with the maker's own utility</strong> — If the manufacturer's scan tool sees the device, the driver is fine and the problem is in the other app's settings.</li>
              <li><strong>Install the FULL package</strong> — Download the complete software bundle for your exact model — the one that lists scanning — not the basic print driver.</li>
              <li><strong>Open the firewall for network scanning</strong> — Allow the maker's scanning utility through your firewall so the scanned image can travel back to the computer.</li>
              <li><strong>For USB: go direct</strong> — Connect to a port on the computer itself with a known-good cable — skip hubs while troubleshooting.</li>
              <li><strong>Restart both ends</strong> — Power-cycle the scanner and reboot the computer, then run a test scan from the OS's built-in tool.</li>

              <div className="faq-body">
                <p>Scans travel from the device back to your computer, and firewalls sometimes block that inbound path. Allow the maker's scanning utility through your firewall and ensure both devices are on the same network.</p>

              <div className="faq-body">
                <p>Check the maker's support page for a driver matching your OS version. Makers eventually stop updating drivers for older models — if yours has been dropped, the OS's built-in scan support sometimes still operates it at a basic level.</p>
